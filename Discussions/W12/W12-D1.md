## W12-D1 Double roof model views

Consider the double roof model, which describes “the typical two views a developer encounters when designing a complex HW/SW system“.

#### 1. Name the two views cited above, and provide a brief explanation of each one of them.

- ***Answer***

The top layer represents the behavioral layer, which is the algorithms and functions. Furthermore, the lower/2nd layer represents the structural layer, which is processors, ASICs, busses, memories, etc.

Two views: Behavioural/Structural as indicated in the picture (also known as functional or specification view to the upper roof, and structural implementation to the lower roof).


#### 2. Briefly relate the codesign work flow to the successive synthesis refinement steps represented in this double roof model.

- ***Answer***

* The codesign workflow usually starts with an Electronic System Level (ESL) specification, given by a behavioral specification of the whole system. This is either model or language based, which are communication tasks, processes or subalgorithms that are part of the specificaiton. 

* The platform model at ESL is typically the structural model of architectural components. Such as, processors, busses, and interconnected components as memories, and HW IP blocks that might be used as accelerators. 

* Design automation is visualized in the double roof model by vertical arrows, each representing a synthesis step. E.g., during logic synthesis, a given specification of a system of Boolean equations or a FSM provided in the form of either a table, diagram, or alternatively HDL specification is given at the level of the functional roof. 

* Logic synthesis then generates a netlist implementing this FSM by choosing variable encodings, applying logic minimization, and finally allocating logic gates and memory elements from a library. So, at the structural roof of the diagram, one would see the netlist as a result of the refinement. Hence, through a synthesis step, a specification is transformed into an implementation at the next lower level of abstraction. 

* Horizontal arrows indicate the step of passing information about the implementation at a certain level directly to the next lower level of abstraction as an additional specification information or constraints. E.g., at the architecture level on the HW side, the allocation would involve determining how many functional units such as multipliers and adders of each type will be chosen to compose the data path of the resulting HW component. Here, the information on the choice of the functional unit such as a carry-ripple-adder with a certain precision would serve as an additional input at the functional level for subsequent logic synthesis of this adder.
