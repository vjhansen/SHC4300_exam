## W08-D1 Napoleon's cipher: Math formula

Consider an early Napoleon’s cipher that uses a matrix with 27 lines and 27 columns, laying out the 26 letters a-z. To encrypt a message, locate its first letter in the first line, proceed downwards until you find the first letter of your key, then proceed to the right until the last column where you’ll find the letter to use in your ciphered message. Move on to the second letter and repeat the procedure. And likewise until the message is completely ciphered. 

The following data path represents a draft of one possible solution, where the encryption/decryption operation is done by a (combinational) cipher block implementing a mathematical formula, a ROM is used to store the key, and a RAM is used to store the encrypted/decrypted messages -- the full encrypted/decrypted message will be sent back to the PC when the ASCII code for the `Enter`-key is received (pressing `Enter` marks the end of the message).

#### 1. Why are the two counters of different types (`mod-m` up counter for A, standard up counter for B)?

>***Answer***

Modulus Counters, or simply MOD counters, are defined based on the number of states that the counter will sequence through before returning back to its original value. In the case of modulo “m” counters, they do not count to all their possible states, but instead count to the “m” value and then return to zero.
The purpose of the Mod-m counter in this ocasion is to cycle through the ROM key.
As we observe, Mod-m counter is 5 bits. This means that the amount of characters in the Cipher key has to be less than 31 (5bits).

As we observe, standard counter is 8 bits. This means that the counter is able to cycle through 255 values (registers in RAM).
This means that the length of the message stored inside RAM is limited up to 255 characters.

#### 2. What factor will define the value of `m`? (limit of the `mod-m` counter)

>***Answer***

The length of the Cipher key must limit the mod-m counter.
In this occasion the key - ´Jean Jacqu esR ousse´ = 17 characters (without spaces, 18 chars with space)

#### 3. What are the limitations imposed by the number of bits presented above for the two counters?

>***Answer***

5bit Mod-m counter - Key length can be up to 31 characters.

8bit Standard counter - Stored message length can be up to 255 characters.

#### 4. Present an ASMD chart that specifies the behaviour of the control path.
