### W06-D2 Napoleon's cipher: Data path

*Consider an early Napoleon’s cipher that uses a matrix with 27 lines and 27 columns, laying out the 26 letters (a-z). To encrypt a message, locate its first letter in the first line, proceed downwards until you find the first letter of your key, then proceed to the right until the last column where you’ll find the letter to use in your ciphered message. Move on to the second letter and repeat the procedure. And likewise until the message is completely ciphered.*

The following data path represents a draft of a possible solution for encryption, where one ROM is used to store the original matrix, a second ROM is used to store the key, and a RAM is used to store the encrypted messages -- the user will type in the message, which each letter being encrypted and stored in RAM as it is received, and the full encrypted message will be sent back to the PC when the ASCII code for the “Enter” code is received (pressing “Enter” marks the end of the message).
