### W05-D2 An electronic piano

Consider the following functional specification for a simple electronic piano represented by the block diagram illustrated below:

* The range of musical notes should cover octaves 4 (261.626 to 493.883 Hz) and 5 (523.251 to 987.767 Hz), and be represented by a set of corresponding ASCII codes according to any computer keys of your choice.

* Each musical note is to be received through an RS232 serial channel and played as soon as it is received.

* Each musical note will continue to play until another valid ASCII code is received (representing another musical note from octaves 4 or 5) or until an invalid ASCII code is received (in which case the music will stop).
