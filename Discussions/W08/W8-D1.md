### W08-D1 Napoleon's cipher: Math formula

Consider an early Napoleon’s cipher that uses a matrix with 27 lines and 27 columns, laying out the 26 letters a-z. To encrypt a message, locate its first letter in the first line, proceed downwards until you find the first letter of your key, then proceed to the right until the last column where you’ll find the letter to use in your ciphered message. Move on to the second letter and repeat the procedure. And likewise until the message is completely ciphered. 

The following data path represents a draft of one possible solution, where the encryption/decryption operation is done by a (combinational) cipher block implementing a mathematical formula, a ROM is used to store the key, and a RAM is used to store the encrypted/decrypted messages -- the full encrypted/decrypted message will be sent back to the PC when the ASCII code for the `Enter`-key is received (pressing `Enter` marks the end of the message).
