### W05-D1 Additional features for the ABC player

Consider the music box specification presented for CCW#2, and assume that you want to extend its functionality in order to support tune loading via RS232 and a local “Play” button as illustrated below. 

**What changes would be required to the original datapath in order to:**

* **Enable up to 8 tunes stored in RAM, and tune selection using 3 switches.**

* **Enable a loop mode that keeps playing the selected tune (press `Play` once to start, press again to stop).**

----
Assuming the 8 tunes already are stored (hardcoded) in RAM.


`sw[2:0]` enables us to select which of the 8 tunes in the RAM we want to play.

E.g. `"000"` = Song 1, `"110"` = Song 7, `"111"` = Song 8.

Note 1 of song 1 will be located in `RAM_ADDR = x"00"`, note 2 in `RAM_ADDR = x"01"` and so on.


| sw[0] | sw[1] | sw[2] | RAM_ADDR |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | -------- |
| 0     | 0     | 0     | x"00"`   |
| 0     | 0     | 1     | x"01"`   |
| 0     | 1     | 0     | x"02"`   |
| 0     | 1     | 1     | x"03"`   |
| 1     | 0     | 0     | x"04"`   |
| 1     | 0     | 1     | x"05"`   |
| 1     | 1     | 0     | x"06"`   |
| 1     | 1     | 1     | x"07"`   |
