## W11-D1 Coprocessor or not?

A C function has 10 inputs and 10 outputs, all of them integers. The function takes 1,000 cycles to execute in SW. You need to evaluate if it makes sense to build a coprocessor for this function. Assume that the function takes K cycles to execute in HW, and that you need Q cycles to transfer a word between the software and the coprocessor over a system bus.

#### 1. Draw a chart that plots Q in terms of K, and indicate what regions in this chart justify a coprocessor.

- ***Answer***

By plotting the equation `1000 = K+20*Q`, the `(K,Q)`-plane is divided in two regions. In one region, the sum `K+20*Q` is smaller than 1000. This means that the total execution time consumed by HW is smaller than the execution time for the same functionality in SW. Hence, the HW coprocessor provides an overall gain in speedup. At the other side of the line, the sum `K+20*Q` is larger than 1000. In this case, the HW coprocessor does not provide any benefit over the SW.
