### W07-D1 Napoleon's cipher: Strength of the key

*Consider an early Napoleon’s cipher that uses a matrix with 27 lines and 27 columns, laying out the 26 letters 'a-z'. To 
encrypt a message, locate its first letter in the first line, proceed downwards until you find the first letter of your key, 
then proceed to the right until the last column where you’ll find the letter to use in your ciphered message. Move on to the 
second letter and repeat the procedure. And likewise until the message is completely ciphered.*

#### 1. Will the encryption method become weaker if the length of the key is reduced? Why?

>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_strength

A random password's information entropy, `H`, is given by the formula:

`H=L*log_2(N)`, where `N` is the number of possible symbols, we have `N=26`, `L` is the "length" or the amount of symbols used in our key.

* `L = 10 -> H = 47 bits`
* `L = 5 -> H = 23.5 bits`


If we specify password strength in terms of information entropy which is measured in bits, a password with an entropy of 47 bits would be as strong as a string of 47 bits chosen randomly, i.e. a password with an entropy of 47 bits would require `2^47` (`1.41e14`) attempts to exhaust all possibilities during a brute force search. Thus, by increasing the entropy of the password by one bit the number of guesses required doubles, making an attacker's task twice as difficult.
