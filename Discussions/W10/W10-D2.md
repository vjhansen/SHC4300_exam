## W10-D2 Hardware implementation of C statements

*N.B.: The source of this question is Patrick R. Schaumont, “A Practical Introduction to Hardware/Software Codesign (Links to an external site.)“, Problem 1.4, pp. 28-29.*

Describe a possible implementation for each of the following C statements in hardware (use a block diagram). You can assume that all variables are integers, and that each of them is stored in a register.

---

#### 1. Code snippet 
```C
a = a + 1;
```

>***Answer***

First value of "a" must be stored in the register in order to increment the value by 1.
We can use "load = 1" to pass through the first value and revert to "load = 0" afterwards.
From that point on, a = a+1 for every clock cycle

#### 2. Code snippet 
```C
if (a > 20)
      a = 20;
```

>***Answer***

By checking first if the value of a is greater than 20, we can with select operation rewrite a's value to 20.
Else, the values less than 20 will get through

#### 3. Code snippet 
```C
while (a < 20) 
      a = a + 1;
```

>***Answer***

By combining the first and second tasks we can obtain "while" implementation
