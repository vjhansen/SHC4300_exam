## W07-D3 Napoleon's cipher: Alternatives

The following data path represents a draft of a possible solution for encryption, where one ROM is used to store the original matrix, a second ROM is used to store the key, and a RAM is used to store the encrypted messages -- the user will type in the message, which each letter being encrypted and stored in RAM as it is received, and the full encrypted message will be sent back to the PC when the ASCII code for the “Enter” key is received (pressing “Enter” marks the end of the message).

#### 1. What blocks in the data path represented above would be eliminated if a mathematical formula was used to look for the encrypted letter, instead of searching for it in the matrix ROM?

>***Answer***

Our group has implemented cipher as mathematical implementation.

#### 2. How would you compare the “mathematical formula” versus “matrix ROM” solutions in terms of advantages and disadvantages?

>***Answer***

ROM matrix solution will actually require a much larger number of clock cycles for each character to encrypt/decrypt since the ROM matrix has to be scanned until a match is detected.

Mathematical solution does not require to cycle through the ROM matrix. This means that the mathematical logic block will deliver the result immediately.

#### 3. What changes would be required to the ASMD chart presented below if the mathematical formula was used instead of the matrix ROM?

>***Answer***

Most of the changes happen in the receiving part. In mathematical implementation the solution does not need to cycle through the ROM matrix.
