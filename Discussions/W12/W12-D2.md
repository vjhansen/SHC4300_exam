### W12 - D2 Codesign level decisions


*Consider the double roof model, which describes “the typical two views a developer encounters when designing a complex HW/SW system“.*

*Explain why “a pure top–down design might not be possible or desirable for many companies in many product cases”, and briefly explain how a “meet-in-the-middle” design strategy provides a better solution in such cases.*

* A pure top–down design might not be possible or desirable for many companies in many product cases. E.g., some components such as CPU types and numbers might have been chosen already early or will be reused in new product lines and thus need to be considered during the mapping. Similarly, during HW design, some existing IP blocks available in the company will be instantiated instead of synthesizing them from the scratch.

* A meeting-the-middle design strategy is a special case of the design flow, because the resource allocations might either be fixed or chosen during a synthesis step on the basis of synthesis constraints. In particular, it will be shown later that the usage of existing components may be achieved by constraining the synthesis problem to use already preallocated components while at the same time reducing the design space.
