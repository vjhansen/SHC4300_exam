### W7-D2 Napoleon's cipher: Switch-defined key

Consider an early Napoleon’s cipher that uses a matrix with 27 lines and 27 columns, laying out the 26 letters a-z. To encrypt a message, locate its first letter in the first line, proceed downwards until you find the first letter of your key, then proceed to the right until the last column where you’ll find the letter to use in your ciphered message. Move on to the second letter and repeat the procedure. And likewise until the message is completely ciphered.

#### 1. Would it be possible to use as key the position of the 8 switches located in the Basys-3 board (instead of a sequence of ASCII codes as represented above)? In case your answer is yes, would that solution provide a stronger cipher than the example key shown above?

- ***Answer***

It is possible to use on-board switches but, 8 switches translated into binary is 8 bits, which is equivalent to 1 char (8 bits). This means that the cipher key is much more stronger than the switches on board.
