## W05-D1 Additional features for the ABC player

Consider the music box specification presented for CCW#2, and assume that you want to extend its functionality in order to support tune loading via RS232 and a local `Play` button as illustrated below.

#### 1. What changes would be required to the original datapath in order to:

  1.1 **Enable up to 8 tunes stored in RAM, and tune selection using 3 switches.**

  1.2 **Enable a loop mode that keeps playing the selected tune (press `Play` once to start, press again to stop).**

If the `sw[2:0]` are MSB of `RAM_ADDR[10:0]`, and the `notes[7:0]` are the LSB of `RAM_ADDR[10:0]`, we have:

`sw[2:0] = RAM_ADDR[10:8]`, and `notes[7:0] = RAM_ADDR[7:0]`

`sw[2:0]` enables us to select which of the 8 tunes in the RAM we want to play.

E.g. `"000"` = Song 1, `"110"` = Song 7, `"111"` = Song 8.

Note 1 of song 1 will be located in `RAM_ADDR = "000 00000001"`, note 8 of song 8 in `RAM_ADDR = "111 00001000"` and so on.


`sw[2:0]` are the 3 MSB of the RAM address bus and will contain the address to the `2^3 = 8` stored tunes. The remaining 8 bits (LSB) in the address bus will be the address to each musical note of a tune. Each tune has the possibility to consist of `2^8 = 256` musical notes. Each musical note is received through UART and stored in the 8 LSB of the address bus.

Looping has to be implemented in the ASMD chart/FSMD code.
