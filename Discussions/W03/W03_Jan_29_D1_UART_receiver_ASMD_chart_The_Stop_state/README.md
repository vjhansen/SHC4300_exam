# Answers

### 1) How would the behaviour of this circuit be modified if we deleted state stop, and asserted the “rx_done_tick” output immediately before leaving state data?

### 2)Change the corresponding VHDL description (listing 7.1 attached) accordingly, and use an appropriate test bench to check if your answer is correct.
