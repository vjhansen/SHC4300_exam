### W01-D1

We have a VHDL description and a testbench for the simple CPU architecture represented below, assuming that only two instructions are supported: `LD R,M` (load R with a data word that is stored immediately after the instruction opcode) and `HALT` (stop program execution).

#### 1. An attached test bench was created to check the execution of a program comprising only two instructions: `LD R,M` (where M should contain ”A0” hexadecimal) and `HALT`. Carry out the simulation, and explain why R loads X"FF" instead of X"A0"; make the appropriate changes so that R loads X"A0".

We have 3 states in this FSMD. R can load A0h by adding an extra clock cycle in the test bench.
```vhdl

-- Stimulus process
stim_proc: process begin 
  reset <= '1';
  db <= "11111111"; -- HALT, X"FF"
  wait for clk_period*2;
  reset <= '0'; 
  db <= "10100000"; -- LD R,M, X"A0"
  wait for clk_period*3; -- 3 clock cycles needed
  db <= "11111111"; -- HALT, X"FF"
  wait for clk_period*50;
end process;

```

#### 2. An attached VHDL description for the CPU shows that the execution of `LD R,M` takes 3 clock cycles. Would it be possible to execute this instruction in less clock cycles? Change the code appropriately if you answer is yes and prove your solution by simulating with your test bench as created for the previous question.

We can move the instructions of `ldrm_2` into `all_1` and use two clock cycles:

```vhdl

---------
when all_1 =>			
  if (ir_pre = LDRM) then
    r_next <= unsigned(db);
    pc_next <= pc_pre+1;
    state_next <= all_0;
---------
  end if;				
---------

```

#### 3. Expand the VHDL description of this simple CPU in order to support two additional instructions: `INC R` (increment the content of R) and `TOG R` (toggle the content of R).


```vhdl

architecture arch of cpu is
---------
	constant LDRM: unsigned := "10100000"; -- X"A0"
	constant INCR: unsigned := "10110000"; -- X"B0"
	constant TOGR: unsigned := "11000000"; -- X"C0"
	constant HALT: unsigned := "11111111"; -- X"FF"
---------

when all_1 =>			
	if (ir_pre = LDRM) then
    		r_next <= unsigned(db);
    		pc_next <= pc_pre+1;
    		state_next <= all_0;
	elsif (ir_reg = HALT) then
		state_next <= all_1;	
      	elsif (ir_reg = INCR) then
		r_next <= r_pre+1; 	-- increment R
		state_next <= all_0;
      	elsif (ir_reg = TOGR) then
		r_next <= not (r_pre);  -- toggle R
		state_next <= all_0;
	else 
		state_next <= all_0;
	end if;
---------
```
