## W04-D4 Music box: ASMD chart analysis

The ASMD chart shown below represents one possible solution to a music box with the following characteristics:

* The melody to be played is stored in RAM as a sequence of ASCII codes.

* All ASCII codes to be stored in RAM are received serially via RS-232.

* Each musical note belonging to octaves 4 or 5 is represented by one ASCII code.

* Specific codes are used to mark the start-of-melody (`“|”`) and end-of-melody (`“]"`).

* The melody stored in RAM will be played when a Play button is pushed.

#### 1. Would it be possible to merge the first two states (`init` and `check_for_ABC`), by moving the `abus <= “0...0”` statement to the state box of the `init` state, and the decision box of `check_for_ABC` into that same state? Draw the resulting new state if yes, or explain why if no.

>***Answer***

It is not possible to merge the first two states simply by moving the `abus <= "0..0"` statement to the state box of the `init` state, and the decision box of `check_for_ABC` into that same state. The logic of accepting musical notes after receiveing start of melody `"|"`, can't be retained.

However it is possible to merge first two states by using one register to store if the start of the melody is received on not.

#### 2. Can we initiate the reception of a new melody (sequence of ASCII codes) while the current melody is being played? If your answer is no, how would you modify the ASMD chart in order to enable it?

No, then we would overwrite the [address register] song being played. We could use a dual-port (two address registers) RAM.
`addr_a_reg` could be used in normal operation, i.e. when we are not receiving a new melody while playing. `addr_b_reg` could be used to store the new melody when we are already reading from `addr_a_reg`.

Thw `play_1`, `play_2` and `check_for_ABC` states of the ASMD would need to be modified.

We cannot initiate reception of new melody while the current melody is being played with same ASMD chart.

To accomodate the changes, we have to have two registers which holds the start of melody address. One register to point which is latest melody. All the states in ASMD has to be modified. The logic to hold music in RAM can be initial partioning, dividing RAM address into two part equally. Other logic can be 2nd melody address can be after the end of the 1st melody.

#### 3. If a user makes a mistake when typing a sequence of keys (musical notes), he might want to restart by pressing the start-of-melody key (`“|”`), and beginning the sequence again. What will happen in such a case, according to the ASMD chart shown above? How would you modify the ASMD chart in order to enable this feature?

>***Answer***

If the user enters `“|”` the received sequence of keys will be cleared.

*Biplav*

No it won't happen with current ASMD chart.

For change we have to add extra desicion box of checking start of melody and transit to `Check_for_ABC` state if true, before checking valid key in the states receiving musical notes i.e `Check_for_ABC` and `store_3`.

#### 4. Will we be able to listen to the melody being downloaded as each new ASCII code is received, according to the ASMD chart shown above? How would this be possible, if your answer is no?

>***Answer***

*Biplav*

No, it is not possible to listen the musical notes at the time of download with current ASMD.

In states `Check_for_ABC` and `store_3`, the state box should be made empty. Two mealy output boxes needs to be added after checking validity of notes. For true `td_on<='1'`, for false `td_on<='0'`.
