## W2-D6 Debouncing FSMD

Consider the ASMD chart represented below, which specifies the behaviour of a debouncing circuit based on a FSMD architecture, and its explicit and implicit datapath descriptions, as represented in listings 6.1 and 6.2.

#### 1. What differences would a user notice in the circuit behaviour, if `q_next` was replaced by `q_reg` in the decision boxes of states `wait1` and `wait0`?

>***Answer***

The user will not notice difference. The `q_reg` in code listing is mapped to `q` in the ASMD chart. As `q_reg` is updated after one clock cycle, the condition will be triggered one cycle later then the original expected time. Just 1 clock cycle delay, it may not be noticed by the user.



#### 2. Modify the ASMD chart in order to ensure that the `db_tick` output pulse rises together with the `db_level` output, instead of immediately before.

#### 3. Modify the ASMD chart in order to generate a `db_tick` pulse also in the case of falling edges of the `db_level` output.

#### 4. Why is it necessary to include the `q_next` signals in the sensitivity list of the `next-state & datapath functional units/routing` process in the implicit VHDL description? (listing 6.2, line 104)

>***Answer***

`q_next` signal is used in if condition inside the process. The change in `q_next` value will trigger the process.
