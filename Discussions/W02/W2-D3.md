## W02-D3 Binary multiplication with a FSMD

Consider a circuit that receives two 4-bit operands, and generates an 8-bit result that represents the product of the two inputs.

#### 1. Represent a block diagram showing an FSMD architecture for this circuit, assuming that the multiplication is carried out by adding `In_A` with itself, for as many times as indicated by `In_B` (e.g. 12 x 5 = 12 + 12 + 12 + 12 + 12).

#### 4. Add to your Xilinx project the necessary blocks to demonstrate the operation of your solution in the Basys-3 board, using the 8 switches to define the two operands, and the 7-segment digits to display the result.

Not finished. Do we need this?

#### 5. What changes would be required to your datapath in order to ensure that the multiplication always takes the smallest possible number of clock cycles?
