These questions are presented under the following assumptions:

* They may be selected to be part of the final exam
* Responses must be posted by the students (not me)
* I will call your attention to any mistakes or wrong content posted in response
 
 The block diagram represented below corresponds to a FSMD architecture that implements the functional requirements of a cheating electronic dice.
 
* Assume that only two operating modes are supported: no cheating, and triple probability for the result specified by inputs “result(2:0)”. Present an ASMD chart that illustrates the behaviour of this FSMD. N.B.: In this case, “mode” is a single input that defines the no-cheating mode when at ‘0’, and the triple probability mode when at ‘1’.
* Make all appropriate corrections and / or simplifications to the ASMD chart represented below, which is supposed to illustrate the behaviour of the architecture represented above, when supporting four operating modes (“00”: no-cheating; “01”: forbidden result; “10”: predefined result; “11”: triple probability).  
* Build the corresponding VHDL description and prove that your solution works by showing simulation results in Vivado.
