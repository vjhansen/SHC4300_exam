## W10-D3 Hardware implementation of C program

*The source of this question is Patrick R. Schaumont, “A Practical Introduction to Hardware/Software Codesign“, Problem 4.6, pp. 108-109.*

Design a hardware implementation (datapath and controller) for the program below, assuming that the elements of array `a[ ]` are all stored in a memory with a single read port. The figure below illustrates such a memory. The time to lookup an element is very short, thus, you can think of this memory as a combinational element.

```C
int a[ ] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};
int findmax ( ) {
      int max, i;
      max = a[0]; // the first element is the largest before we start looking for others
      for (i = 1; i < 10; i++)
            if (max < a[i]) // if a[i] > max then the new max = a[i]
                  max = a[i];
      return max;
}
```

>***Answer***

This program aims to find the largest element in an array `a[ ]`. `a[ ]` could be stored in ROM, we need to iterate through the array by incrementing the ROM address. We need a block which compares the value of `max` and the value located at the current ROM address.
