### W05-D1 Additional features for the ABC player

Consider the music box specification presented for CCW#2, and assume that you want to extend its functionality in order to support tune loading via RS232 and a local “Play” button as illustrated below. What changes would be required to the original datapath in order to:

* Enable up to 8 tunes stored in RAM, and tune selection using 3 switches.

* Enable a loop mode that keeps playing the selected tune (press “Play” once to start, press again to stop).
