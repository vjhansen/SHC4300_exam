### W05-D1 Additional features for the ABC player

Consider the music box specification presented for CCW#2, and assume that you want to extend its functionality in order to support tune loading via RS232 and a local “Play” button as illustrated below. 

**What changes would be required to the original datapath in order to:**

* **Enable up to 8 tunes stored in RAM, and tune selection using 3 switches.**

* **Enable a loop mode that keeps playing the selected tune (press `Play` once to start, press again to stop).**

ASCII[7:0]
`A=01000001`
`C=01000011`

`sw[2:0]` enables us to select which of the 8 tunes in the RAM we want to play.

E.g. `"000"` = Song 1, `"110"` = Song 7, `"111"` = Song 8.

Note 1 of song 1 will be located in `RAM_ADDR = x"00"`, note 2 in `RAM_ADDR = x"01"` and so on.
