## W06-D2 Napoleon's cipher: Data path

*Consider an early Napoleon’s cipher that uses a matrix with 27 lines and 27 columns, laying out the 26 letters (a-z). To encrypt a message, locate its first letter in the first line, proceed downwards until you find the first letter of your key, then proceed to the right until the last column where you’ll find the letter to use in your ciphered message. Move on to the second letter and repeat the procedure. And likewise until the message is completely ciphered.*

The following data path represents a draft of a possible solution for encryption, where one ROM is used to store the original matrix, a second ROM is used to store the key, and a RAM is used to store the encrypted messages -- the user will type in the message, which each letter being encrypted and stored in RAM as it is received, and the full encrypted message will be sent back to the PC when the ASCII code for the “Enter” code is received (pressing “Enter” marks the end of the message).

#### 1. Present an ASMD chart for the data path architecture shown above, including receive and transmit states.

>***Answer***

(please check the slides at https://bit.ly/2yyZEfh):

* The ROM key output is not needed to generate the address of the ROM matrix – what is important is that both addresses are incremented according to the same rules when encrypting or decrypting.
* The ROM key output does not need to be fed to the control path, because it is needed only for the comparator (recall that we’re following the procedure described in slide #1)
* When the content of the addressed position in the ROM matrix is stored in the RAM, it represents the encrypted / decrypted value (according to the procedure in slide #1)
* The explanation of how the output of the ROM matrix represents the encrypted / decrypted value is summarized in slide #1, and in more detail in the ASMD chart shown in slide #7

 
But please notice that this solution is not really a good solution, when compared with the use of a mathematical function as we did during the implementations (summarized in slides 8-15). It was good to support the discussion and to shown that there are more effective alternatives, but not necessarily recommendable for implementation…


#### 2. Would it be possible to improve the solution presented above for the data path core (comprising the matrix ROM and the blocks to its left up to the receiving UART subsystem)?

>***Answer***

Yes, by using [**our**](https://github.com/deivyka/SHC4300/tree/master/CCW2_Napoleon_Cipher/Napoleon_Cipher_FSMD_implementation) solution.
