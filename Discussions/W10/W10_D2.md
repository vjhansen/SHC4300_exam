W10 Mar 18 (D2) Hardware implementation of C statements

N.B.: The source of this question is Patrick R. Schaumont, “A Practical Introduction to Hardware/Software Codesign (Links to an external site.)“, Problem 1.4, pp. 28-29.

Describe a possible implementation for each of the following C statements in hardware (use a block diagram). You can assume that all variables are integers, and that each of them is stored in a register.

```C
a = a + 1;
```
 
```C
if (a > 20)
      a = 20;
```

```C
while (a < 20) 
      a = a + 1;
```
