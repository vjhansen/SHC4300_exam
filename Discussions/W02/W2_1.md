The picture shown below represents the minimum set of blocks required to implement an architecture that is able to execute a program stored in memory, including a basic CPU and an external 8-bit memory (`N=32`) that is used to store instructions and data items.


* Present an ASMD chart for a `JRZ M` (Jump if R is zero).
* Add this instruction to your Vivado Basic CPU project and paste below the simulation waveforms that prove its correct operation.
