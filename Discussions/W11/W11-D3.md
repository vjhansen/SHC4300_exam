## W11-D3 Double roof model


“Codesign (...) does not only provide important design aids at the system level. At the same time, it should allow to combine existing (semi)automated design steps and interface different abstraction levels to a large degree. Thereby, codesign will accomplish the necessary design refinements automatically, save development time, and allow for the fast verification of the above design steps“. The typical abstraction levels herein referred are usually represented in the form of a double roof model that was initially introduced by Jürgen Teich in 2000.

- The **System level** describe the complete system to be designed, which include communication subsystems (processors, ASIC memories etc.). 

- The **Block-level** may be related to SW domains, which consists of behavioral models such as programs, functions and procedures. 

- The **Module (task)** also belongs to the SW side, whereas models at this level show the interaction of complex functions, such as process networks and task-level graphs. 

- The **Logic level** is on the HW side of the model, which consists of netlists of various gates and registers, as well as support for boolean functions and FSMs. 

- The **Architecture level** represents RTLs (register transfer level blocks) and internal signals and communication within a system. 

The two shown roofs describe the typical two views a developer encounters when designing a complex HW/SW system. 

- The **upper roof** describes the functional or specification view of the system at the corresponding abstraction level.

- The **lower roof** describes its structural implementation, including allocated resources as well as schedule and binding decisions and the corresponding code. 

- **Design automation** is visualized in the double roof model by **vertical arrows**, each representing a synthesis step. Through a synthesis step, a specification is transformed into an implementation at the next lower level of abstraction. 

- **Horizontal arrows** indicate the step of passing information about the implementation at a certain level directly to the next lower level of abstraction as an additional specification information or constraints.
