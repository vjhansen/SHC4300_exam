## W13-D1 Array sorter

*N.B.: This question is inspired in Patrick R. Schaumont, “A Practical Introduction to Hardware/Software Codesign“, Problem 5.2, pp. 151-152.*

Consider a high-speed sorter for four 32-bit registers:

#### 1. Present an FSMD architecture that implements this functionality.

>***Answer*** (By Amin)



- We start by considering the original array filled in with 4 elements ("Input" in the picture above), and an ordered array initially empty ("Output").

- For each element in the original array (`index j = 0, 1, 2, 3`), count the number of elements that is lower than `a[j]`.

- Use this number as an index (address) to store this element in the ordered array.

- Repeat until `j=3` inclusive. If we try to design the data path for this approach, we realise that we need two counters (to generate the indexes / addresses for the two arrays), one register to hold each element of the original array as `j` goes from `0` to `3`, and one comparator. And of course we have the original array and the ordered array. We can now define the status and control signals that need to be connected to the control path, and then we can draw a detailed data path architecture.

#### 2. Can you compare the speed of your hardware architecture to an equivalent software solution?

>***Answer***
The HW architecture will be a parallel implementation. The SW solution will be a sequential implementation, and will not be able to reach the same speed as the HW solution.
