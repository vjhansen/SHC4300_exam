### W01-D1

VHDL description and a testbench for the simple CPU architecture represented below, assuming that only two instructions are supported: `LD R,M` (load R with a data word that is stored immediately after the instruction opcode) and `HALT` (stop program execution).

#### 1. The attached test bench was created to check the execution of a program comprising only two instructions: `LD R,M` (where M should contain ”A0” hexadecimal) and `HALT`. Use Vivado to carry out the simulation, and explain why R loads FFh instead of A0h; make the appropriate changes so that R loads A0h.

#### 2. The attached VHDL description for the CPU shows that the execution of `LD R,M` takes 3 clock cycles. Would it be possible to execute this instruction in less clock cycles? Change the code appropriately if you answer is yes and prove your solution by simulating with your test bench as created for the previous question.

#### 3. Expand the VHDL description of this simple CPU in order to support two additional instructions: `INC R` (increment the content of R) and `TOG R` (toggle the content of R).
