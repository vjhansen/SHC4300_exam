### W7-D2 Napoleon's cipher: Switch-defined key

*Consider an early Napoleon’s cipher that uses a matrix with 27 lines and 27 columns, laying out the 26 letters a-z. To encrypt a message, locate its first letter in the first line, proceed downwards until you find the first letter of your key, then proceed to the right until the last column where you’ll find the letter to use in your ciphered message. Move on to the second letter and repeat the procedure. And likewise until the message is completely ciphered.*

#### Question

Would it be possible to use as key the position of the 8 switches located in the Basys-3 board (instead of a sequence of ASCII codes as represented above)? In case your answer is yes, would that solution provide a stronger cipher than the example key shown above?

#### Answer

With the 8 switches we can have `2^7 = 128 bits`.

With cipher key we have 17 characters (excluding spaces) with 8bits pr char size `17*8 = 136 bits`

With spaces it gives us `20*8 = 160 bits`

The cipher key is still stronger than the switches on the board

*Alternative*
8 switches translated into binary is 8 bits which is equivalent to 1 char (8 bits), this means that the cipher key is much more stronger than the switches on board
