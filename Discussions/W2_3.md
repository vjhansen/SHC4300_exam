Consider a circuit that receives two 4-bit operands, and generates an 8-bit result that represents the product of the two inputs.

* Represent a block diagram showing an FSMD architecture for this circuit, assuming that the multiplication is carried out by adding In_A with itself, for as many times as indicated by In_B (e.g. 12 x 5 = 12 + 12 + 12 + 12 + 12).
* Represent an ASMD chart for this FSMD.
* Create a Xilinx project to implement this FMSD, and demonstrate its correct operation through simulation.
* Add to your Xilinx project the necessary blocks to demonstrate the operation of your solution in the Basys-3 board, using the 8 switches to define the two operands, and the 7-segment digits to display the result.
