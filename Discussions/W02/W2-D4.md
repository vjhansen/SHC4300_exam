### W02-D4 Odd parity generator as a FSMD: From a datapath to an ASMD chart

*Consider an odd parity generator receiving a 9-bit frame that comprises a start bit (`0`) followed by 8 data bits. This circuit counts the number of `1`'s in the data bits field, and generates an odd parity output on each 9th clock cycle (see the example below). N.B.: The odd parity output will be `1` when the number of `1`'s in the data bits field is even (so that the total number of `1`'s are odd), and `0` otherwise.*

*This circuit may be implementation as a simple FSM, but we want to design it as a FSMD using the datapath illustrated below. Present an ASMD chart for the corresponding control path.*
