### W04-D1 Tune duration versus RAM size


Consider a sequence of ASCII codes representing musical notes that need to be stored in memory with the objective of controlling the frequency of a square wave output. The UART, the RAM block, and the programmable waveform generator, are all part of the datapath of the corresponding FSMD, which is represented below. The behaviour of the circuit may be described as follows:

* The output will remain at logic `0` until a rising edge is detected in the `Play` input.

* Once the `Play` input is activated, the square wave output starts with a frequency defined by the content of the first RAM position.

* After 0.5 sec. the frequency of the square wave changes to the value defined by the second RAM position.

* This process repeats itself up to the last code received through the RS232 port, and afterwards the output will revert to logic `0`

#### 1. What will the maximum duration of a tune if the RAM block comprises 1 Kbyte?

- ***Answer***

Assuming ASCII codes have 8 bit (1 byte). Then the maximum duration of a tune of a RAM block comprised of 1 Kbyte is: `1000 byte * 0.5 s = 500 s = 8.33 m`.

We may need to use some of the bytes to store control codes, but their number will always be very small – so we can safely consider that we'll have space to store a tune up to 8+ minutes.

 The exact duration will be `998 byte * 0.5 s = 499 s`. Due the control codes. One for the start of the melody `(` and one for the end of the melody `)`.

#### 2. How can we know if the byte currently received is the first byte of a new sequence, or an additional byte of an on-going sequence? How can we know if the byte currently received is the last one in a sequence?

- ***Answer***

It may be good to choose different codes to indicate the start and the end of a tune – if you make a mistake while typing the sequence of codes, inserting the "begin-of-tune" code will enable you to restart (and will not be taken as the end of the current tune). The 1st byte of a sequence could be sent as `(` and the last byte of a sequence could be sent as `)`.
