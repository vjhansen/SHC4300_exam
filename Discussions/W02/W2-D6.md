### W2-D6 Debouncing FSMD


Consider the ASMD chart represented below, which specifies the behaviour of a debouncing circuit based on a FSMD architecture, and its explicit and implicit datapath descriptions, as represented in listings 6.1 and 6.2 (attached).

#### 1. What differences would a user notice in the circuit behaviour, if `q_next` was replaced by `q_reg` in the decision boxes of states `wait1` and `wait0`?



----

#### 2. Modify the ASMD chart in order to ensure that the db_tick` output pulse rises together with the `db_level` output, instead of immediately before.

----

#### 3. Modify the ASMD chart in order to generate a `db_tick` pulse also in the case of falling edges of the `db_level` output.

----


#### 4. Why is it necessary to include the `q_next` signals in the sensitivity list of the `next-state & datapath functional units/routing` process in the implicit VHDL description? (listing 6.2, line 104 in the attached file)
