## W02-D4 Odd parity generator as a FSMD: *From a datapath to an ASMD chart*

### Questions

Consider an odd parity generator receiving a 9-bit frame that comprises a start bit (`0`) followed by 8 data bits. This circuit counts the number of `1`'s in the data bits field, and generates an odd parity output on each 9th clock cycle (see the example below). N.B.: The odd parity output will be `1` when the number of `1`'s in the data bits field is even (so that the total number of `1`'s are odd), and `0` otherwise.

> Fig.1

This circuit (fig. 1) may be implementation as a simple FSM, but we want to design it as a FSMD using the datapath illustrated below. **Present an ASMD chart** for the corresponding control path shown in FSM bellow.

## W02-D5 Odd parity generator as a FSMD: *Implementation flaw*

### Questions

This circuit (fig. 1) may be implementation as a simple FSM, but we want to design it as a FSMD using the ASMD chart represented below, and the corresponding VHDL description presented in attachment.

A simulation session using the input sequence illustrated below (test bench equally in attachment) shows that this solution does not meet the requirements specified above. **Identify the problems and correct the ASMD chart to avoid them (see W02-D4 above).**
