### W11 - D2 Codesign tasks

*“Apart from the necessity of specification, formal analysis, and cosimulation tools for performance and cost analysis, (...) the major synthesis problem in codesign of electronic systems (...) involves **three major mapping tasks**.”*

Name these three tasks, and present a brief description of each one of them.


----

#### 1. Allocation
Select a set of system resources including processors, HW IP blocks (e.g. interfaces, memories, etc.), and their interconnection network, through composing the system architecture in terms of resources. These resources could be existing as library templates. Alternatively, the design flow should be able to synthesize them.

----
#### 2. Binding
Map functionality (i.e. tasks, processes, functions or basic blocks) onto processing resources, variables and data structures onto memories, and communications to routes between corresponding resources.

----
#### 3. Scheduling
Determine when functions are executed on the proper resources including function execution, memory accesses, and communication. This might involve either the definition of a partial order of execution or the specification of schedulers for each CPU and communication and memory resources involved as well as task priorities, etc. functionality (i.e. tasks, processes, functions or basic blocks) onto processing resources, variables and data structures onto memories, and communications to routes. between corresponding resources.
