## W04-D2 Simplified ABC music notation

Consider a sequence of ASCII codes representing musical notes that need to be stored in memory with the objective of controlling the frequency of a square wave output. The UART, the RAM block, and the programmable waveform generator, are all part of the datapath of the corresponding FSMD, which is represented below. The behaviour of the circuit may be described as follows:

* The output will remain at logic `0` until a rising edge is detected in the `Play` input.

* Once the `Play` input is activated, the square wave output starts with a frequency defined by the content of the first RAM position.

* After 0.5 sec the frequency of the square wave changes to the value defined by the second RAM position.

* This process repeats itself up to the last code received through the RS232 port, and afterwards the output will revert to logic `0`

#### 1. Departing from the ABC music notation format, introduce a number of reasonable simplifications that will minimize the storage requirements for the “sequence of ASCII codes representing musical notes” referred above.

>See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_notation

ASCII codes are 8-bit values representing the characters in the ASCII table. However, the ABC format will use more than one ASCII to define one musical note -- it may for example also contain temporal information.

```
X: 1 - sequence number, useful for selecting one tune out of a file full of tunes.
T: Tune Title
C: Composer's name
N: Notes about the tune, any kind of comment, ignored by the software.
M: 3/4 - meter, M:2/4 is two/four time; M:6/8 is jig time, etc.
L: 1/8 - default note length; here it's an eighth note
K: G - gives the key. K:Em would mean E minor.
```

The `X:` and `T:` lines should be the first two lines, and the `K:` line should be the last header line. The `K:` line is followed by music, with a blank line to separate the tune from whatever follows.

Example:

```
----Header
X: 1
T: Balance the Straw
R: jig
N: Sometimes assorted other things are praised by the angels.
N:
M: 6/8
L: 1/8
K: G

An ABC tune comprises an information body and a tune body, as explained in http://abcnotation.com/wiki/abc:standard:v2.2. 

**The question addresses possible simplifications "Departing from the ABC music notation format", such as discarding the information body, removing time information from the tune body, etc.**
