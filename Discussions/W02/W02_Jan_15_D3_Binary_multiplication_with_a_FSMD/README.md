# Answers
### 1) Represent a block diagram showing an FSMD architecture for this circuit, assuming that the multiplication is carried out by adding In_A with itself, for as many times as indicated by In_B (e.g. 12 x 5 = 12 + 12 + 12 + 12 + 12).

### 2) Represent an ASMD chart for this FSMD.

### 3) Create a Xilinx project to implement this FMSD, and demonstrate its correct operation through simulation.

### 4) Add to your Xilinx project the necessary blocks to demonstrate the operation of your solution in the Basys-3 board, using the 8 switches to define the two operands, and the 7-segment digits to display the result.
