### W04-D2 Simplified ABC music notation


Consider a sequence of ASCII codes representing musical notes that need to be stored in memory with the objective of controlling the frequency of a square wave output. The UART, the RAM block, and the programmable waveform generator, are all part of the datapath of the corresponding FSMD, which is represented below. The behaviour of the circuit may be described as follows:

* The output will remain at logic `0` until a rising edge is detected in the `Play` input.

* Once the `Play` input is activated, the square wave output starts with a frequency defined by the content of the first RAM position.

* After 0.5 sec the frequency of the square wave changes to the value defined by the second RAM position.

* This process repeats itself up to the last code received through the RS232 port, and afterwards the output will revert to logic `0`

Departing from the ABC music notation format, introduce a number of reasonable simplifications that will minimize the storage requirements for the “sequence of ASCII codes representing musical notes” referred above.
